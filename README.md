# activity_portal
An activity portal where users, in a team, can log their activities for reviews, comments and approvals by supervisors at various levels as set within the team.
This task was taken up to illustrate how to build a web application from knowledge gained in learning HTML and CSS. 

### How It Works
The practise which this project seeks to improve is that staff activities are often reported to supervisors via email only. This makes tracking and organisation of reports difficult. Also, when departmental reports are to be collated, the teams end up spending  more time than they would have trying to collate, sort and prepare reports for managers.  
So, with the **activity portal**, a staff simply logs the daily activities, their supervisors can review the logs and provide immediate feedback. Also, the staff can provide update to the logged  item too.
And when the reporting cycle appraoches, all the team member responsible for reporting does is log in to the **activity portal**, and spool and reports that have the supervisor's approval. Although, the portal ensures that *only* supervisor-approved logs are available for report collation. 
### Future Goal
There would be an updated version of this where functionality would be added through Javascript. And then maybe another upgraded version would utilise a JS framework like ReactJS (with NextJS).
